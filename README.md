## Overview
This is a single-page static website designed to highlight my background as a software developer. It includes sections for "About Me," "Skills," and "Contact," with a navigation bar for easy access. The site uses custom CSS for styling and hover effects to enhance user interaction.

## Features
- **Navigation Bar**: Links to "About," "Skills," and "Contact" sections.
- **About Section**: A brief introduction with a profile photo placeholder and a programming quote.
- **Skills Section**: A list of skills with icons and hover effects (image scaling) for visual appeal.
- **Contact Form**: A simple form for users to send messages (currently static, no backend).
- **Responsive Design**: Basic layout adaptable to different screen sizes.

## Technologies Used
The project is built with:
- **HTML**: Structure of the website.
- **CSS**: Styling, including hover effects and layout design.

Additionally, my skill set featured on the site includes:
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Python
- Adobe Photoshop
- Video Editing
- Git/GitHub
- Frappe
- Docker
- Flutter
- SQL
- Node.js
- MongoDB
- React
- C++

## Setup
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   ```
   Replace `your-username` and `your-repo-name` with your GitHub username and repository name.

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
   ```bash
   cd your-repo-name
   ```

3. **Open the Site**:
   - Open `index.html` in a web browser (e.g., Chrome, Firefox) by double-clicking the file or using a local server.

   **Optional - Use a Local Server**:
   - If you have Python installed:
     ```bash
     python -m http.server 8000
     ```
   - Or with Node.js (requires `http-server`):
     ```bash
     npx http-server
     ```
   - Then visit `http://localhost:8000` in your browser.

## Usage
- Browse the site to view my "About" section, explore my skills with interactive hover effects, and use the contact form (note: the form is static and requires a backend for functionality).
- Customize the content by editing `index.html` and `styles.css` to reflect your own details.

## Contributing

### Notes:
1. **Assets**: The `README` assumes images (e.g., `ph.png` for the profile photo and skill icons) are in the repository root or a subdirectory like `images/`. Update paths in `index.html` if needed.
2. **Deployment**: If you plan to host this on GitHub Pages, add a deployment section to the `README` (e.g., "Run `gh-pages -d .` after installing `gh-pages`").
3. **Contact Form**: The form is static. For a functional form, you'd need a backend (e.g., Node.js or a service like Formspree), which could be added as a future enhancement.
